# NTS Lite

Lite version of [NTS.live Infinite Mixtapes](https://www.nts.live/infinite-mixtapes) for old devices with low memory. Also Live Stream 1 and 2 included.

As a huge fan of NTS Radio, I love listening to it on my old iPad, but the modern website is too heavy for its limited RAM. Launching any other app eventually causes the Safari background tab with the original NTS website to reload, which stops the music due to memory constraints. So I decided to build a lightweight version of the NTS site focused solely on infinite mixtapes and live streams.
